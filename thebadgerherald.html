				This article details Tyler Wahl's basketball career as he prepares to
				finish his fifth season at the University of Wisconsin. He was an
				absolute joy to speak with and was friendly and welcoming. His high
				school coach, John Oxton, was the same way. I loved speaking with them,
				and tried to tell the story of Wahl so that he, his family, 
				as well as Oxton and Lakeville North can be celebrated.
